For the JavaSales unit test, in the bid method test make sure to bid a valid amount.
The test makes sure that a bid has been added to the item.

The rest of the tests are ran autonomously.

So far, we are just testing some basic things to ensure basic functionality.
Once we have a bigger code base we will have more tests.

Future planned tests: data validation/ exception tests on some input methods,
and more tests on menu items. Probably some tests on our future "time simulation"
as well.
