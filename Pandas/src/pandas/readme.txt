Admin Password: password

Sample Customer Username: jdoe	
Sample Customer Password: password

Currently the admin menu and new user sign up menus are not implemented, but the sample user can bid on existing item(s). We also have a rough idea of how we are going to implement the rest of the project features in the future.

To Use Program:
Load sample data using menu item #1
Log on as the sample customer "John Doe" with the username "jdoe" and password "password"
Choose menu item #3 to bid on an existing item

for the JavaSales unit test, in the bid method test make sure to bid a valid amount.
The test makes sure that a bid has been added to the item.
