Instructions:


STEP 1)
When you run the program, the first thing you must do is load the customers.csv file.
The file is filled with a bunch of silly fake customers with their own usernames and passwords.
To load, press 1 and open up the file in the dialog box that pops up.

You don't have to input ANY custom data for customers into the keyboard (you can, but you don't need to).
Simply press 0 and hit enter over and over again. 
Pressing 0 will advance time and generate new bids for each item automatically.
That means you don't have to load in a file for the bids. They are just generated automatically and follow
all the necessary rules.

STEP 2)
After 5 PM, the auction house closes, and all bids are put in a queue to be processed the next day.
After you spam 0 and enter on your keyboard to get to 9:00 AM again, you won't be able to advance past 9
until you clear the backlog. To do this, press 2.

You will see most bids fail; this is because all the bids are based on the values that were present before the
auction house closed. That means that maybe some of the first bids that come in after closing will be successful,
but all the ones after those won't (as you would expect).

STEP 3)
The only thing you have to manually do is close auctions.
Simply login as an admin. (press 3) and input "password" for the password

Then, press 6 to close an auction, and choose the auction you want to close.

To view the winner of the auction you closed, press 4 for "Summary data of winning bids".

From the admin menu, you can also make new auctions (option 5). The customers will automatically bid for the new item.
You can check bidding histories, etc from the admin menu as well.


Extra Info:
To add a new customer, just press 4 from the main menu and then press 2 and follow the instructions
